## HW 5 on Clustering and SVMs is here:
[link to NL Project github](https://github.com/NelsonLau/SG-DAT-NL/tree/master/Project)
Look for SVM: (https://github.com/NelsonLau/SG-DAT-NL/blob/master/Project/05_NL_Project_SVM.py)
and output: (https://github.com/NelsonLau/SG-DAT-NL/blob/master/Project/05_svm_output.txt)
kmeans is a few different files: 05_NL_Project_kMeans...
and kmeans output: (https://github.com/NelsonLau/SG-DAT-NL/blob/master/Project/05_output.docx)

Managed to do some clustering, but results aren't awesome; would like to try to look at elbow plots.

Managed to do some SVM fitting, but had issues with the fitting getting 'stuck' and not completing. I will try to add a timeout function. It looks like some 2-variable and 3-variable SVM fits may be interesting.
