# homework


Hi guys, please pull this repo, create a new folder called YOUR_NAME.

And then push your new folder! Remember:

```
git add -A .
git commit -m "hey"
git pull origin master # to make sure you have all updates first
git push origin master
```

Thereafter you can add your homework and `push` every week :)

If there are any questions, do ask on Slack!
