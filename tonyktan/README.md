**Saving Airbnb from Listing Saturation**  
_Data-driven Boosting of New Host Listings_

**Background**

Founded in 2008, Airbnb has developed into a mature hospitality sharing economy company, providing short-term stays in homes around the world. With over 2 million listings in over 190 countries, Airbnb’s host base is maturing, with popular homes in every major city, validated by numerous 5-star ratings and positive reviews.

With a developed host base, the Airbnb host community is facing saturation. The platform can only list a limited number of listings in each geographical area, and new hosts are finding it hard to differentiate themselves from experienced hosts. This would restrict growth of Airbnb host base, which would in turn constrain Airbnb’s overall growth.

With limited listing space on its platform, Airbnb must develop ways to give new hosts a good chance of building up a track record. Up against mature listings with validated ratings and reviews, promising new hosts need a differentiating factor to signal their quality.

That being said, how would Airbnb distinguish between the mediocre entrants from the promising ones? Would location be a factor? It would be useful if the platform could somehow discern between the good from the bad entrants. Otherwise, it would be placing possibly mediocre listings ahead of good and experienced listings, which would otherwise give users a better experience.

This brings about the basis of our project. Applying data science techniques to Airbnb’s data, we will see if we can predict the popularity of listings.
