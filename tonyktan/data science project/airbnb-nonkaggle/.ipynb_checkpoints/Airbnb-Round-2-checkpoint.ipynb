    "So upon deep reflection, I have decided to forsake Kaggle and to search for data sources on the internet, so that I go through the process of looking for data. After a few days of searching, I chanced upon this website [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) that had a trove of airbnb data from a anti-airbnb advocate. I have downloaded the Nov 2015 SF data and it looks promising so far, so let's see what we can do with it."
